I use ecclipse to run the program
If it's your first time running it, it will prompt you for currency and target rate and it will write it to the target file
so that you won't have to do it again next time. 
Then it will call and parse the xml for the target rate. It will show on the console as well as write to rate.txt
It's scheduled to run every 10 seconds right now through java timer scheduler 
It will give you an option to go with the current rate or enter new rate.
